📝 PROFESSIONAL PROFILE

Engineering graduate (Mechatronics & IoT) with a robust foundation in numerical analysis, mathematical modeling, and simulation. Proficient in MATLAB for control system design and signal processing, alongside Python for data automation. Unlike a generalist analyst, I bring an engineering perspective to data—adept at interpreting technical datasets, validating sensor accuracy, and translating complex signals into actionable insights. Eager to leverage strong analytical skills to support Codingo Assignments' global projects.
