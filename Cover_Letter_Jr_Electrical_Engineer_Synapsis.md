Subject: Application for Jr. Electrical Engineer - Muhammad Hafizh Maulidan

Dear Synapsis Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the **Jr. Electrical Engineer** position at **Synapsis**, as advertised. As a Mechatronics Engineering graduate from IPB University with a strong passion for Renewable Energy and IoT integration, I am thrilled at the prospect of contributing to your innovative solar panel IoT projects.

My background perfectly bridges the gap between electrical engineering and smart technology. During my internship at PT Matra Kreasi Mandiri, I led the development and field deployment of an IoT flood monitoring system. This experience honed my skills in:
*   **Electrical System Design**: Configuring power monitoring, creating stable wiring layouts for outdoor environments, and integrating sensors with microcontrollers (ESP32).
*   **Field Commissioning**: Performing on-site installations, troubleshooting electrical faults in real-time, and ensuring systems adhered to safety standards (K3).
*   **Reliability Engineering**: Maintaining a 99% uptime for deployed devices through rigorous testing and preventive maintenance.

I specifically admire Synapsis's mission to integrate solar energy with IoT for smarter monitoring and optimization. My experience in **sizing power systems** for battery-operated devices and my proficiency in **troubleshooting electrical circuits** directly align with the responsibilities of configuring PV systems and conducting diagnostic tests.

I am eager to bring my problem-solving skills, technical adaptability, and readiness for field work to your team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can support Synapsis's engineering goals.

Sincerely,

**Muhammad Hafizh Maulidan**
